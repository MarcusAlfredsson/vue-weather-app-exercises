# vue-weather-app-exercises

The purpose of this project is to try the different parts in VueJS and in the same time build something useful.
This project will be based on a number of steps and in the end the result will be a weather app. There are also branch which you can checkout to see the result of each exercise.

## Pre steps

## Step 1, add elements to a list

In the first step we want to create an input component that can add new elements to a list.

## Step 2, remove elements from that list

In this step we should add an button to each element, that when clicked should remove the actual element from the list

## Step 3, save the list and load on update

Now we want to save the list of elements and use the same list on enter or reloads of the page

## Step 4, get weather for a city

## Step 5, show weather information

## Step 6, click clicking on a city, route to a new page

## Step 7, weather page should display specific weather for the clicked city
